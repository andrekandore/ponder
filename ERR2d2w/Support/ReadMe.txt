To use this framework, I would recommend you work with 
Project Wonder source in your workspace.  You can find 
instructions on how to do this on the wiki.  The patches 
folder in this directory contains patches for project 
wonder on which this framework depends.  You will need 
to apply these patches to your wonder source in order for 
everything to work correctly.  The Project Templates.zip 
file is a compressed archive of project templates for 
use with this framework.  See the readme file contained 
in that archive for more information.
