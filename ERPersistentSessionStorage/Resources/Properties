#The number of seconds for which a session may be idle before it times out.
#The default is 3600 seconds (one hour). A value of 0 means sessions never
#time out.
#WOSessionTimeOut=0

#The WOSessionStore removes session automatically at a specific interval.
#The problem is it does not check to see if the session is distributed.
#In order to prevent one instance from removing a session which another 
#instance might be using, we turn it off by making the interval the max
#integer value possible. This should be sufficient to prevent premature
#session deletion unless you plan on having an app uptimes > 24 days.
