In theory, this framework should be all one needs to store sessions persistently in a database. In practice, serializing a WOSession is not quite so simple due in large part to the backtrack cache.  Since every page and every component in the cache must serialize properly, this framework is not very useful. I keep it in case I one day have lots of time to work on impossible things.
